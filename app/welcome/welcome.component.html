<h4>Welcome!</h4>

<p>This is a tool for taking live statistics for sports or esports. 
    When you're ready, check our the "Add" and "Events" tabs. When 
    an event happens, you will add the specifications in the "Add" 
    tab and hit submit. Then you will see the event has been added 
    in your event tab. Once you are done adding events, go to the 
    "Summary" page and click the "Get Summary" button to get a 
    game summary report that you can save or take a screenshot of.
